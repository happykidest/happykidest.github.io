Well. I guess I'm launcing this dummy website? It's for practice so I can make a nice one in the future. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, i'll try to make sure I keep everything here
